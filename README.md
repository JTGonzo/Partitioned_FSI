# DISCLAIMER!!
These codes were very recently uploaded (March 20th, 2024) from my system and have yet to be vetted for general distribution/use. I am currently working through commenting, cleaning and re-testing these solver which were put together approximately 1 year ago. Please allow me the next few weeks to clean up the codes so as to make them more instructive, easy to use, and bug-free. 

If the reader is still compelled to experiment I encourgae them to do so, however, `while this disclaimer is being displayed` I suggest that one exercises ***reasonable*** caution when using the partitoned solvers provided.

## Download, Installation and Running

## Strongly Coupled Partitioned FSI Solver

<ins>***2D Rigid-Body FSI solver***</ins><br>
This partitioned FSI scheme was developed at the [University of British Columbia](https://cml.mech.ubc.ca/) by the graduate students of my superviosor [Dr. Rajeev Jaiman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iofAU68AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). It uses stabilized streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) P<sub>m</sub>/P<sub>m-1</sub>/P<sub>m</sub> iso-parametric finite elements to satisfy the inf–sup condition of the fluid domain equations. The solid domain is simply modelled as an elastically mounted rigid cylinder that is free to translate along its two directional degrees of freedom. Temporal discretization is achieved via the generalized-&alpha; method for each set of domain equations.

Further reading on this approach can be found in 
>[**[RKJ17] L. Zhong, W. Yao, K. Yag, R. Jaiman, B. C. Khoo,. On the vortex-induced oscillations of a freely vibrating cylinder in the vicinity of a stationary plane wall **, Journal of Fluids and Structures, 2016.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2016.07.001)

<ins>***2D & 3D redbKIT-based solvers***</ins><br>
This repository contains 2D and 3D high-fidelity computational fluid-structure interaction solvers built (mainly) in MATLAB. They are primarily focused on solving two-field problems in a partitioned fashion, where the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations - written in the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) form - are coupled with the nonlinear elastodynamics structural equations. For 2D FSI problems the user has the option to choose either a linear elastic constitutive material model for the structural mechanics solver (**2D_Part_FSI_LE**) or a nonlinear St. Venant Kirchhoff material model (**2D_Part_FSI_SVK**). For 3D FSI problems, the user can additionally choose a nearly-incompressible NeoHookean constitutive material model for the structural mechanics solver (**3D_Part_FSI_NH**). 

These solvers all use a Galerkin least-squares finite element strategy for each set of domain specific equations. Here we exclusively use higher-order P<sub>2</sub> finite elements for the structural equations and stable Taylor-Hood P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub> mixed finite elements for the fluid equations. A second-order backward difference scheme is adopted for the temporal discretization of the fluid domian whilst the generalized-&alpha; method is used for the structural domian. 

In all cases (except for the 2D rigid-body solver) each code was derived from a corresponding [redbKIT monolithic FSI](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Monolithic_FSI) solver. These solvers were decomposed into their baseline elements and were then strategically reassembled and further built upon such that we finally ended up with a **partitioned** numerical framework. These partitoned solvers (given above) served as a robust testbed for my subsequent investigation of ["*coupling  instability in low mass-ratio partitioned FSI simulations*"](https://jtgonzo.github.io/). From this effort, algorithmic solutions to stabilize and accelerate the fixed point coupling procedure comensurate with the partitioned approach [were recommended](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Multi-Threaded_Partitioned_FSI).  

Features unique to the partitioned strategy that have been included in each of the solvers provided include:<br>

  - Anderson Acceleration
  - Generalized Broyden
  - Broyden's Second Method

  - QR2 (Classic Gram-Schmidt) filtering
  - QR2 (Modified Gram-Schmidt) filtering
  - QR2 (Householder Reflections) filtering

  - Projection and Linear Interpolation
  - Radial Basis Function Interpolation

* Extrapolation Methods:

  - Quadratic
  - Cubic

* [Work in Progress Tools](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Multi-Threaded_Partitioned_FSI):

  - Adaptive Regularization Least Squares
  - Selective Secant Inclusion
  - Truncated SVD filtering

## Further Clarifying Details
For absolute clarity, the [**redbKIT**](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT) toolkit by itself is an ***AMAZING*** resource for (young) academics seeking an education in the finite element method and reduced-order modelling. As such, I **strongly** recommend the reader fork that repository and work through redbKIT's numerous well crafted example problems. `*I personally give this resource the lion's share of credit in helping me complete my graduate studies.*`

These solevrs, however, are of a monolthic construction and thus linearization of one set of domain equations with respect to the other must occur for the system of equations to be well-posed. If the interested reader is more interested in the details of **partitioned** coupling, however, or would like to develop one of the respective domain solvers independently of the other domain they may find the tools found in this repository very useful.

Lastly, for those readers seeking a more digestible version of the rebKIT-based monolthic FSI solvers or the individual (rebKIT-based) domain-specific solvers I have additionally compiled what I believe to be useful respources in the following repositories: 
  1. [Monolithic Fluid Structure Interaction solvers](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Monolithic_FSI)
  2. [Single Domain (CFD & CSM) solvers](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Single_Physics_Solvers)

## redbKIT : a MATLAB(R) library for reduced-order modeling of parametrized PDEs

redbKIT is a MATLAB library for finite element simulation and reduced-order modeling of Partial Differential Equations developed at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) - [Chair of Modeling and Scientific Computing](http://cmcs.epfl.ch/)). 

In particular, it includes straightforward implementations of many of the algorithms presented in the companion book:
